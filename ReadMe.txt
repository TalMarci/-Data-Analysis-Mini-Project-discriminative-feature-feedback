Data Analyses Project implemented by Tal Marciano and Alon Ben Melech.

In this Project, we implemented a machine learning algorithm for a multi-class classifier using explanation and feedback to learn and improve.
The Algorithm that we implemented was created by Dr. Sivan Sabato and is thoroughly explained in her paper:
https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/file/36ac8e558ac7690b6f44e2cb5ef93322-Paper.pdf



This project has two parts.
1) Python implementation of the algorithm.
2) Try to think about how can this algorithm be improved and implement and test that idea.

A PDF (with visuals) was added to the repo, explaining the way we implemented every part using Object-oriented programming.
