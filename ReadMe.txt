Data Analyses Project implemented by Tal Marciano and Alon Ben Melech.

**This Project was written as part of Sivan Savato Ben-Gurion Course 'Subjects in data analysis'.
  I do not claim any copywrite rights to my self. only showing our take and implementaion.

In this Project, we implemented a machine learning algorithm for a multi-class classifier using explanation and feedback to learn and improve.
The Algorithm that we implemented was created by Dr. Sivan Sabato and is thoroughly explained in her paper:
https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/file/36ac8e558ac7690b6f44e2cb5ef93322-Paper.pdf

This project has two parts.
1) Python implementation of the algorithm.
2) Try to think about how can this algorithm be improved and implement and test that idea.

A PDF (with visuals) was added to the repo, explaining the way we implemented every part using Object-oriented programming, the data sets used and conclusions.

simply run part1 inorder to run our algorithm implementation, or part2 inorder to run our take on what can be change in order to improve it.
